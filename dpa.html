Subject-Matter, Nature, Purpose and Term of the Data Commission<br><br>‍</strong>3.1.   A description of the Data Commission, including information on the subject-matter, nature and purpose of the Processing, the types of Personal Data and the categories of data subjects, shall be specified in <strong>Annex 1</strong>. Any changes to <strong>Annex 1 </strong>shall be agreed by the Parties.<br><br>3.2.  The term of the Data Commission depends on the term of the Agreement and ends when all Personal Data Processed have been deleted or returned to the Controller pursuant to § 13 of this DPA. <br><br>‍<br><strong class="heading-5">4. Controller’s Instructions<br><br>‍</strong>4.1.  Comet Rocks shall Process Personal Data relating to Controller within the scope of the Data Commission in accordance with the provisions of the this DPA and Controller’s instructions, unless Comet Rocks is obliged by the law of the EU or the EU member states to which Comet Rocks is subject to process the data otherwise. In such a case, Comet Rocks shall notify the Controller of these legal requirements, unless the relevant law does prohibit such notification due to an important public interest.<br><br>4.2.  Comet Rocks shall not use Controller’s Personal Data Processed subject to this DPA for any other purposes, in particular not for its own purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that Comet Rocks may Process Controller’s Personal Data for own purposes when executing the Agreement; such Processing for own purposes is not subject to this DPA. <br>‍<br>4.3.  Controller’s right to issue instructions relates to the Processing of its Personal Data. In case any instructions change, cancel or supplement the stipulations made in the Agreement and/or <strong>Annex 1 </strong>of this DPA, these instructions come only into effect if they are jointly agreed and documented by the Parties at least in text form. If necessary, the Controller may also issue instructions orally or by telephone. However, instructions given orally or by telephone shall require immediate confirmation by the Controller at least in text form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Controller shall document all instructions issued by it.<br><br>4.4.  Comet Rocks shall immediately notify the Controller, if in its opinion an instruction issued by the Controller violates the Applicable Data Protection Laws and/or the provisions of this DPA. Comet Rocks shall give reasons for its opinion to such an extent that the Controller is able to review it. In such a case, Comet Rocks shall be entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Controller has changed the instruction or the Parties have come to the conclusion within the framework of the respectively applicable escalation procedure that there is no violation of the Applicable Data Protection Law and this DPA.<br><br><br>5. <strong class="heading-5">Confidentiality of Processing<br><br>‍</strong>Comet Rocks undertakes to maintain confidentiality when Processing Controller&#x27;s Personal Data, in particular by ensuring that all persons acting under the authority of Comet Rocks regarding the Data Commission, such as employees as well as other persons subordinate to Comet Rocks (e.g. freelancers), have committed themselves to maintain confidentiality or are subject to an appropriate statutory duty of confidentiality. Comet Rocks warrants that it will familiarize such persons with the provisions of the Applicable Data Protection Laws (to the extent applicable to such persons). <br>‍<br><br>6. <strong class="heading-5">Data Security<br><br>‍</strong>6.1.   Comet Rocks shall protect Controller&#x27;s Personal Data by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures pursuant to Art. 32 GDPR. Comet Rocks must ensure that appropriate measures are taken to ensure ongoing integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems as well as to quickly restore the availability of Personal Data and access thereto in cases of technical incidents. Moreover, Comet Rocks shall ensure that the Processed Personal Data is strictly separated from any other data sets. A documentation of the technical and organisational measures taken by Comet Rocks is described in <strong class="body-bold">Annex 3</strong>. <br><br>6.2.  The technical and organisational measures implemented by Comet Rocks shall be subject to continuous updating and adjustment reflecting the technical and organisational progress. Comet Rocks ensures that any changes to the technical and organisational measures must provide at least an equal level of protection as the measures documented in <strong class="body-bold">Annex 3</strong>. Implementation of any planned changes which do not at least provide an equal level of protection, require Controller’s prior consent at least in text form. Comet Rocks will document any changes to the technical and organisational measures and provide the Controller upon request about the technical and organisational measures implemented at the time of the request with an updated <strong class="body-bold">Annex 3</strong> (text form is sufficient).<br><br>6.3.  In case Comet Rocks is subject to a data breach which affects Controller’s Personal Data, Comet Rocks will immediately take appropriate measures in order to secure the Personal Data and to reduce any potential negative consequences for the data subjects in consultation with the Controller.<br><br><br>7. <strong class="heading-5">International Data Transfer<br><br>‍</strong>7.1.  In the event that the Controller is located in a Third Country, any transfer of Personal Data between Comet Rocks and Controller subject to Artt. 44 et seq of the GDPR shall be covered by Module 4 of the EU SCC, whereas Comet Rocks acts as data exporter and Controller as data importer und these EU SCC, unless such transfer is subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR. Module 4 of the EU SCC hereby applies by way of incorporation and without separate signatures being necessary upon execution of the Agreement.<br><br>7.2.  The Parties hereby acknowledge that this DPA (including its exhibits, annexes and attachments) contain multiple information required under the EU SCC and Annexes I, II and III of the EU SCC. For reference and documentation purposes, the SCC-Matrix in Annex 4 provides an overview where the information required under the EU SCC are set forth in the DPA.<br><br>7.3.  The EU SCC provide the Parties with several options regarding the application of certain provisions and requirements laid down in Module 4 of the EU SCC. The Parties hereby agree that Module 4 of the EU SCC shall apply as follows:<br><br>7.3.1. The Parties hereby agree that Section I, Clause 7 of the EU SCC (“Docking Clause”) is applicable.<br><br>7.3.2. The Parties hereby agree to opt-out from the redress option set forth in Section II, Clause 11(a) of the EU SCC. <br><br>7.3.3. The Parties hereby agree in accordance with Option 2 as set forth in Section III, Clause 17 of the EU SCC that the EU SCC shall be governed by the laws of Germany.<br><br>7.3.4. The Parties hereby agree in accordance with Section III, Clause 18 of the EU SCC that any disputes arising from the EU SCC shall be submitted to the courts of Berlin, Germany. <br><br>7.4.  The Parties may agree on supplementary safeguards in addition to the technical and organisational measures listed in Annex 3 for any transfer between Comet Rocks and Controller if and to the extent such supplementary safeguards are required to ensure compliance with the requirements under Module 4 of the EU SCC.  <br><br>7.5.  In case the EU SCC are amended or replaced by the European Commission through another instrument providing appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR, this new instrument shall replace the EU SCC integrated in this DPA. In case the application of this new instrument requires any amendments to this DPA to ensure compliance with the applicable legal provisions, the Parties will immediately undertake appropriate measures to carry out such amendments without undue delay.<br><br>7.6.  Nothing in this DPA shall be construed to prevail over any conflicting clause of the EU SCC.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">8. Subprocessors<br><br>‍</strong>8.1.   Comet Rocks is entitled to use the Subprocessors listed in <strong class="body-bold">Annex 2</strong> to carry out the processing on behalf of the Controller. Controller hereby consents to the use of the Subcontractors named therein upon conclusion of the Agreement. Comet Rocks shall also be entitled to add further Subprocessors or to replace existing Subprocessors, unless the Controller objects to such changes within a reasonable period of time and based on a legitimate reason. Comet Rocks shall inform the Controller in due time about the intended addition or replacement of other Subprocessors.<br><br>8.2.  Comet Rocks shall contractually ensure that the data protection obligations contained in this DPA are imposed in substance to the respective Subprocessor so that the principles in Article 28 (3) GDPR are complied with. This also includes the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures by the Subprocessor. If a Subprocessor fails to comply with its data protection obligations, Comet Rocks shall be liable to the Controller for compliance with the obligations of that Subprocessor.<br>‍<br>8.3.  For the sake of clarification, the Parties acknowledge that the provisions in this § 8 only apply to the engagement of Subprocessors providing services which relate directly to the Data Commission. This does not include ancillary services used by the Comet Rocks, e.g. telecommunications services, postal/transport services, maintenance and user services or the disposal of data carriers. To the extent necessary, however, Comet Rocks shall also make appropriate and legally compliant arrangements with such ancillary service providers.<br>‍<br>8.4.  If Comet Rocks engages Subprocessors which Process Controller’s Personal Data in a Third Country, Comet Rocks shall ensure that the transfer of Controller’s Personal Data to the Subprocessor complies with the requirements in Art. 44 et seq. GDPR.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="heading-5">9. Controller’s Review Rights<br><br>‍</strong>9.1.   Controller shall be entitled to monitor Comet Rocks’ compliance with the provisions made in this DPA and the Applicable Data Protection Laws to a reasonable extent, insofar as they relate to the Processing of the Controller’s Personal Data. Comet Rocks shall make available to Controller all information necessary to demonstrate its compliance. For this purpose, Comet Rocks may submit current, meaningful test certificates, reports or report extracts from independent bodies (e.g. auditors, auditing, data protection officers, IT security department, data protection auditors, quality auditors), evidence of compliance with approved codes of conduct pursuant to Art. 40 GDPR or suitable certification pursuant to Art. 42 GDPR.<br><br>9.2.  If there is good cause, the Controller shall be entitled to carry out its own review and enter Comet Rocks’ business premises in order to carry out on-site inspections there. Good cause shall be deemed to exist, for example, if the evidence provided to the Controller is insufficient or if, based on the evidence or for other reasons, the Controller is justifiably concerned that Comet Rocks is not complying with the requirements of the Applicable Data Protection Laws and/or Comet Rocks is violating the provisions of this DPA. The Controller shall carry out the on-site inspections during Comet Rocks’ normal business hours and shall give Comet Rocks due notice of such on-site inspections and coordinate them with Comet Rocks. Comet Rocks shall provide the Controller with all information required for the inspection. In doing so, the Controller shall take due account of Comet Rocks’ operating procedures and justified confidentiality interests.<br><br>9.3.  The Controller shall be entitled to carry out the inspection activities in accordance with this § 10 itself or through an authorized representative who is obliged to maintain secrecy. Comet Rocks may object to the execution of the control actions by an authorized representative if there is an important reason. An important reason exists, for example, if Comet Rocks is in a competitive relationship with the authorized representative.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">10. Data Subjects’ Requests<br><br>‍</strong>10.1.  Controller is exclusively responsible for deciding on and fulfilling of data subjects’ requests, in particular requests relating to access, erasure, rectification, blocking as well as transferring of Personal Data. Comet Rocks shall not be entitled to decide on and fulfil requests addressed to it by a data subject, unless explicitly instructed by the Controller or Comet Rocks is legally obliged to do so.<br><br>10.2. If a data subject contacts Comet Rocks directly to assert his or her rights, in particular those stated in Artt. 12 to 23 GDPR, with regard to Personal Data Processed on behalf of the Controller, Comet Rocks shall forward such requests to Controller without undue delay.<br><br>10.3. Comet Rocks shall reasonably support Controller in order to respond to data subjects’ requests. For this purpose, appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be provided for by Comet Rocks.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">11. Assistance by Comet Rocks<br><br>‍</strong>11.1.   Comet Rocks shall support Controller in a reasonable manner with regard to adhering to the obligations stated in Artt. 32 to 36 GDPR, including provision of any required information which are available for Comet Rocks.<br><br>11.2.  Should supervisory authorities request information from or take measures at Controller, Comet Rocks shall, upon request, offer its support to the extent that is required to settle the matter.<br><br><strong class="heading-5">12.Notifications, Contact<br><br>‍</strong>12.1.  Comet Rocks shall without undue delay notify Controller:<br><br>12.1.1. In the event of enquiries and measures by a supervisory authority, in particular of any intended data protection audits, if these measures also affect Controller and/or its Personal Data.<br><br>12.1.2. If any Personal Data breaches in the meaning of Art. 4 Nr. 11 GDPR or severe disruptions or irregularities of the Processing operations covered by this DPA have occurred or if the provisions of this DPA have been violated. This particularly concerns the loss of the Personal Data Processed by Comet Rocks, unauthorised or unintended access to the Personal Data by third parties and/or their unauthorised disclosure. This duty to notify already applies if there is concern that potential disruptions, breaches or irregularities may have taken place with some degree of probability.<br><br>12.2. Controller shall send any instructions, notifications, information or other communications addressed to Comet Rocks pursuant to this DPA to privacy@comet.rocks. Comet Rocks will send any notifications, information or other communications addressed to Controller pursuant to this DPA to Controller’s Initial User or Authorized Users (as defined in the Agreement) via the Comet Platform or email-address.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">13. Deletion and Return of Personal Data<br><br>‍</strong>13.1.  Upon completion of the agreed services or earlier upon request by the Controller – at the latest when terminating the Agreement – Comet Rocks shall return, delete or destroy all data files that have come into its possession, unless Comet Rocks is obliged to store the Personal Data under the law of the EU or the law of the member states of the EU. If such an obligation to data storage exists, Comet Rocks shall restrict the Processing of the Personal Data and use the data only for the purposes for which an obligation to storage exists. Comet Rocks shall delete the Personal Data without undue delay as soon as the obligation to store the data ceases to apply.<br><br>13.2. Upon request, Comet Rocks will confirm to Controller the deletion or destruction of Personal Data. In case of electronic data, the data sets shall be handed over in a format to be agreed upon by the Parties, or, if no agreement has been made, on standard data storage media in a format that is customary in the market and permits a structured readout.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">14. Final Provisions<br><br>‍</strong>14.1.  There are no verbal ancillary agreements to this DPA. This DPA may not be amended, modified or superseded, unless expressly agreed at least in text form by both Parties. This shall also apply to any amendment to this form clause.<br><br>14.2. This DPA shall be governed by German law with the exclusion of its conflict of law provisions. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply.<br><br>14.3.
