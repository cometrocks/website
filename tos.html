The Comet Platform is a digital self-service solution for Merchants and Publishers which allows them to set up and manage individual Satellite Stores in order to offer goods to End Customers. For this purpose, the Comet Platform provides Merchants and Publishers with a digital ecosystem with multiple services and functionalities which can be individually selected and customized, including e-commerce related services to process transactions with End Customers. At the same time, the Comet Platform serves as a digital hub which aims to facilitate cooperation between Merchants and Publishers. In this context, Comet Rocks acts as a technical intermediary, which operates the Platform on behalf of the Merchants and Publishers. Access to and use of the Comet Platform requires that each Merchant and Publisher enters into a legally binding agreement with Comet Rocks. In this context, these Terms of Use for Merchants explicitly govern the contractual relationship between Comet Rocks and each Merchant, whereas Publishers are exclusively subject to the Terms of Use for Publishers.Now therefore, Parties agree as follows:<br>‍<br><br><strong class="heading-5">1.

Upon request, Merchant will provide Comet Rocks with sufficient information to demonstrate its compliance with the Agreement, in particular any required licenses, permissions and/or consents. <br><br> <br><strong class="heading-5">6. Comet Rocks’ Provision of the Comet Platform to Merchant<br><br>‍</strong>6.1. Comet Rocks provides the Comet Platform to Merchant as a digital self-service solution with multiple Platform Services and Third Party Services which can be individually selected by Merchant. In order to get access to and use the Platform Services and Third Party Services Merchant must comply with the onboarding requirements pursuant to § 7.<br><br>6.2. Based on the Comet Platform’s nature as a digital self-service solution Merchant is responsible for implementing the selected Platform Services and Third Party Services, including the setup, configuration and customizing of Satellite Stores within the available technical parameters. Comet Rocks will assist Merchant with the implementation as part of the technical operation of the Comet Platform if and to the extent agreed by the Parties in accordance with § 16. <br><br>6.3. Access to and use of Third Party Services is at Merchant’s own risk and may be governed by terms and conditions of the respective third party service provider (if any). Comet Rocks is not liable for Merchant’s access to and use of any Third Party Services and does not provide any warranty or representation for any Third Party Services, in particular regarding the availability or functionality of any Third Party Services. <br><br>6.4. Comet Rocks may at its sole discretion (further) develop, test, implement and/or replace existing or new services, applications and functionalities of the Comet Platform (including any Platform Services), provided that the core services, applications and functionalities of the Platform remain in place or are replaced by an equivalent; this applies accordingly to any Third Party Services. Comet Rocks may process any Merchant Data on an aggregated, anonymous basis which cannot be associated with Merchant and/or its End Customers to analyse and improve use of the Comet Platform. This may also include training of existing or new algorithms and data models based on aggregated, anonymous Merchant Data. Merchant hereby acknowledges and agrees to the use of its Merchant Data for such purpose and hereby grants to Comet Rocks a corresponding non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-transferable, non-cancelable, permanent right to use any of its Merchant Data.<br><br>6.5. In the event that Merchants requires any additional applications, functionalities or services to be developed for, integrated into and/or connected with the Comet Platform which go beyond the existing functional scope of the Platform Services and Third Party Services available in the Comet Platform, Comet Rocks may carry out such development, integration and/or connection only if mutually agreed in accordance with § 16. Merchant agrees and acknowledges that it is at Comet Rocks’ sole discretion to determine whether any such additional applications, functionalities or services shall be considered as Platform Services or Third Party Services and to provide them to other Merchants using the Comet Platform. <br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">7. Merchant’s Onboarding to the Comet Platform<br><br>‍</strong>7.1.  Merchant must complete the Merchant Onboarding by complying with the onboarding requirements in order to<strong> </strong>get access to and use the full functional scope of the Comet Platform. This includes, <em>inter alia</em>, connection of the Merchant Systems with the Comet Platform via the Comet API and/or prebuild connections within the Merchant Systems (e.g. plugins, cartridges, extensions, custom apps). Merchant acknowledges that Comet Rocks gives no warranty or representation that the Comet Platform will be compatible with any Merchant Systems, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the Technical Documentation.<br><br>7.2.  Merchant is responsible for complying with the onboarding requirements at its own expenses. The onboarding requirements are set forth in the Technical Documentation. Comet Rocks will assist Merchant with complying with the onboarding requirements, in particular with the implementation and maintenance of any technical requirements or specifications, only if and to extent described in the Technical Documentation (if any); any other assistance is provided by Comet Rocks to Merchant only if and to the extend mutually agreed by the Parties in accordance with § 16. <br><br>7.3.  Merchant must ensure to comply with the onboarding requirements set forth in the Technical Documentation throughout the whole term of the Agreement; otherwise Merchant’s access to and use of the Comet Platform may be limited. Merchant agrees and acknowledges that Comet Rocks is not liable for any disruptions to or restrictions in Merchant’s access to or use of the Comet Platform due Merchant’s lack of compliance with the onboarding requirements set forth in the Technical Documentation. <br><br>7.4.  Comet Rocks may change the Technical Documentation from time to time at its sole discretion. Comet Rocks will notify the Merchant with reasonable advance notice of any planned changes to the onboarding requirements set forth in the Technical Documentation to the extent that such changes may have an impact on Merchant’s access to and use of Comet Platform, unless such prior notification is not feasible (e.g. immediate change of technical requirements due to a security incident); in the latter case Comet Rocks will notify the Merchant within reasonable time afterwards. <br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">8. Onboarding and Administration of Authorized User <br><br>‍</strong>8.1.  Once the initial onboarding is completed, Merchant‘s access to the Comet Platform is enabled through the Authorized Users, meaning the Initial User account registered as part of the registration process pursuant to § 3 and any other additional Authorized User.<br><br>8.2.  Merchant must ensure during the whole term of the Agreement that any data required for the registration of an Authorized User account is complete and correct and that all Authorized Users are sufficiently qualified to use the Comet Platform properly. <br><br>8.3.  Merchant is solely responsible for managing its Authorized Users and their use of the Platform, in particular for granting the correct access authorizations to each Authorized User within the Comet Platform. Comet Rocks shall not be liable for any violations by Authorized Users in connection with the use of the Comet Platform.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">9. Merchant’s Provision of the Comet Platform to End Customers<br><br>‍</strong>9.1.   The Comet Platform is provided to Merchant as a whitelabel solution. This means that Merchant is responsible for using any Platform Services and Third Party Services providing them to End Customers in its own name and under its own brand. This applies in particular to provision of any Satellite Stores by Merchant to End Customers. In this context, Merchant shall remain the responsible party (<em>Verantwortlicher</em>) towards the End Customers in terms of any contractual relationship as well as compliance with the applicable laws, in particular data protection and consumer protection laws. <br><br>9.2.  Comet Rocks only acts as a technical intermediary, which operates the Comet Platform on behalf of the Merchant, and is not liable for any acts or omissions of the Merchant, its Authorized Users and/or End Customers. Comet Rocks does not act as seller of any goods towards End Customers and does not enter into any agreement with End Customers. Merchant shall ensure that no Authorized Users and/or End Customer asserts claims against Comet Rocks and Merchant shall indemnify Comet Rocks from any such claims being brought against Comet Rocks.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="heading-5">10. Payment Services, Processing of Transactions <br><br>‍</strong>10.1. The Comet Platform enables the Merchant to process payments executed by End Customers via the Comet Platform by using the payment services provided by the payment processor engaged by Comet Rocks. The payment processor currently engaged by Comet Rocks is Stripe Payments Europe, Limited and Stripe Technology Europe, Limited (both together “<strong>Stripe</strong>”). <br>‍<br>10.2. Merchant agrees and acknowledges that by using Stripe’s Connect Service Comet Rocks is acting as a so-called Stripe Connect Platform under the Stripe Connect Agreement and the Stripe Service Agreement; the current version of which are available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/de/legal/connect-account" class="text-blue">https://stripe.com/de/legal/connect-account</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/de/legal/ssa" class="text-blue">https://stripe.com/de/legal/ssa</a>, whereas Merchant does not enter into a contractual relationship with Stripe as specified in Stripe’s Recipient Agreement, available at <a href="https://stripe.com/de/legal/connect-account/recipient" class="text-blue">https://stripe.com/de/legal/connect-account/recipient</a>. <br><br>10.3. In its function as Stripe Connect Platform under the Stripe Connect Service, Comet Rocks is responsible for creation and administration of an online account with Stripe (so-called “connected account”) which allows Stripe to accept any payments by End Customers to the Merchant as part of a transaction executed between these two parties via the Comet Platform and to move funds to Merchant’s bank account. <br><br>10.4. In case the Merchant decides to use its own payment processor via its existing online store Stripe will not provide any payment services to the Merchant and the Merchant is solely responsible for the processing of any payments. <br><br>10.5. Merchant agrees and acknowledges that the payment services provided by Stripe and/or the contractual relationship established between Comet Rocks and Stripe may be subject to change and that this may also affect Merchant’s use of the Comet Platform.

Restricting Access to and Use of the Comet Platform<br><br>‍</strong>12.1.   Comet Rocks is entitled to suspend the access of Merchant or of specific Authorized Users to the Comet Platform temporarily or permanently subject to the following terms and conditions:<br>‍<br>12.1.1.   Comet Rocks is entitled to suspend the access of specific Authorized Users to the Comet Platform temporarily or permanently after prior notice if such Authorized User fails to comply with the requirements set forth in the Agreement, in particular those set forth in § 11, or violates the rights of third parties and/or any applicable laws.<br>‍<br>12.1.2.   Comet Rocks is also entitled to suspend Merchant&#x27;s access to the Comet Platform temporarily or permanently after prior notice if Merchant fails to comply with the requirements set forth in the Agreement, in particular those in § 11, or violates the rights of third parties and/or any applicable laws. Comet Rocks may also suspend Merchant’s access if one or multiple Authorized Users violate the requirements set forth in this Agreement, the rights of third parties and/or any applicable laws. <br><br>12.2.   Any suspension of Merchant’s access to the Comet Platform means suspending the access of all Authorized Users to the Comet Platform and ceasing the operation of the Comet Platform for the Merchant so that Comet Platform is not available for any End Customers during the suspension.<br>‍<br>12.3.   Before taking one of the aforementioned measures, Comet Rocks shall give the prior notice to the Merchant about the measure, unless such prior notice is inappropriate (e.g. due to an imminent critical threat to the Comet Platform); in the latter case, Comet Rocks will notify the Merchant without undue delay (<em>unverzüglich</em>) after the measure was taken. <br><br>12.4.   Comet Rocks will reinstate any temporary suspension if Merchant has proven to Comet Rocks in a reasonable and comprehensible way and to Comet Rocks satisfaction that the violation in question has ceased and Merchant has taken appropriate precautions to prevent such violations for the future. <br><br>12.5.   Any temporary or permanent suspension of Merchant’s or Authorized Users’ access shall not be deemed as termination of this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise by Comet Rocks. Any temporary or permanent suspension shall not relief Merchant from any of its payment obligations under this Agreement. <br><br>12.6.   Any further rights, in particular Comet Rocks‘ right to terminating this Agreement for due cause (<em>Kündigung</em> <em>aus wichtigem Grund</em>), remain unaffected.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">13. Availability of the Comet Platform<br><br>‍</strong>13.1.   The Comet Platform is made available to the Merchant with an availability of 99,5% on an annual average, based on twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.. Comet makes reasonable efforts to provide the Comet Platform without interruption depending on the technical and operational possibilities of Comet Rocks as well as Comet Rocks’ subcontractors. Comet Rocks does not provide any warranty or representation regarding the availability of any Third Party Services; availability of any Third Party Services is at the sole responsibility of the respective third party vendor.<br>‍<br>13.2.   Maintenance services as well as technical or other malfunctions and problems which are outside of Comet Rocks‘ sphere of influence (e.g. acts of Force Majeure, unavailability of third party systems) can lead to a temporary downtime of the Comet Platform. Such failures are not considered to be an impairment of availability. Comet Rocks will endeavour to give notice of any unavailability of any applications, services and functionalities within reasonable time prior to any such unavailability to Merchant. Otherwise, Comet Rocks will notify Merchant within reasonable time afterwards.<br>‍<br>13.3.   It is not a breach of availability if Merchant and/or Authorized Users and/or End Customers are unable to use the Comet Platform due to (a) problems arising from their software, hardware or other technology or equipment, (b) problems with their access to the internet or (c) problems arising from third party systems over which Comet Rocks does not have any influence (e.g. unavailability of public telecommunication networks, unavailability of Merchant Systems). <br>‍<br>13.4.   The Comet Platform shall be deemed to be operating and available if the Comet Platform is up and running in the data centres where its components are hosted in and such data centres are connected to the internet (“<strong class="body-bold">Point of Transfer”</strong>). <br>‍<br>13.5.   The Parties may agree on specific service levels regarding the availability of the Comet Platform in a separate service level agreement. In this event, such service level agreement shall prevail over the terms and conditions in this § 10.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">14. Maintenance, Support<br>‍<br>‍</strong>14.1.   Comet Rocks shall provide maintenance services for the Comet Platform to ensure availability and functionality of the Comet Platform as agreed hereunder.

Comet Rocks may, at its sole discretion, perform maintenance services during the aforementioned hours to the extent necessary to ensure security and use of the Comet Platform by Merchant as agreed in the Agreement.<br>‍<br>14.3.   Merchant shall immediately report to Comet Rocks any defects, malfunctions or unavailability of the Comet Platform via the Support as defined in § 14.5. Merchant’s rights in case of defect shall be handled and executed within the scope of the maintenance services provided by Comet Rocks as defined in this § 14. If the Merchant demands rectification due to a defect, Comet Rocks is entitled to choose the type of rectification.<br>‍<br>14.4.   Any warranty claims under the applicable statutory law shall expire within 1 year. The period begins once Merchant is able to access the Comet Platform or uses the Comet Platform after provision of the respective Program Parts within the scope of the maintenance services. Any claims for damages are subject to the limitations set forth under § 18.<br>‍<br>14.5.   Comet-Rocks shall set up a point of contact in form of an e-mail address (“<strong>Support</strong>”) to respond inquiries submitted by Merchant in connection with the use of the Comet Platform and the reporting of defects. The Support does not handle any inquiries submitted by End Customers. The Support will be available during Comet Rocks’ usual business hours on Monday to Friday; excluded are national public holidays and public holidays in Germany and Berlin. <br>‍<br>14.6.   The contact details of the Support are available on the Comet Website and may be subject change at Comet Rocks’ sole discretion.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">15. Right of Use<br><br>‍</strong>15.1.   Comet Rocks hereby grants Merchant for the term of the Agreement a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, geographically unrestricted right to use the Comet Platform in accordance with the purposes set forth in this Agreement. <br>‍<br>15.2.   This right of use granted to Merchant also includes making the Comet Platform available to Authorized Users and End Customers for the purposes set forth in this Agreement. Merchant is not permitted to commercially exploit the Comet Platform by distributing or selling it or parts thereof to third parties.<br>‍<br>15.3.   Merchant is not entitled to examine the mode of operation by way of so-called &quot;reverse engineering&quot;, modify, edit, transfer or decompile the Comet Platform or parts thereof, unless this is expressly permitted by law and/or required for using the Comet Platform in accordance with the purposes of this Agreement. <br>‍<br>15.4.   To the extent that Comet Rocks requires any rights, including any intellectual property rights and know-how, from Merchant for the provision of its services under the Agreement, the Merchant hereby grants Comet Rocks a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, irrevocable, non-cancable right to use such rights during the term and for the purpose of executing this Agreement.<br>‍<br>15.5.   The granting of the aforementioned rights shall not be associated with any transfer of ownership and property rights. These shall remain with the respective parties.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">16. Additional Services<br><br>‍</strong>16.1.  As agreed between the Parties from time to time, Comet Rocks may provide the following additional services which are relating to or associated with the Comet Platform but do not fall under the scope of services Comet Rocks is obliged to provide under this Agreement:<br>‍<br>16.1.1.   Services in connection with the individual setting up, configuration, customization and optimisation of the Comet Platform for the Merchant, including of any Platform Services and Third Party Services as well as any of Merchant’s Satellite Stores.<br>‍<br>16.1.2.   Services in connection with the assistance of the Merchant regarding the implementation and maintenance of the technical requirements and specifications set forth in Technical Documentation, provided that these services are not owed by Comet Rocks pursuant to the Technical Documentation.<br><br>16.1.3.   Services in connection with the training of Merchant and its Authorized Users with respect to access to and use of the Comet Platform.<br>‍<br>16.1.4.   Services in connection with the development, integration and connection of additional services, applications and functionalities required by Merchant for/into/with the Comet Platform.<br><br>16.1.5.   Services in connection with rectification of defects caused by the Merchant or any of Merchant’s Authorized Users or other persons or entities engaged by Merchant pursuant to 17.2.<br><br>16.2.   The above list of additional services is not exhaustive. Therefore, it cannot be concluded from the lack of mentioning of certain services in this § 16 that such services are the subject of Comet Rocks‘ contractual obligations under this Agreement. <br><br>16.3.   Depending on the type of the additional service, Comet Rocks shall render the additional service against payment of a separate remuneration based on time and effort or at a fixed price and within the scope of its operational possibilities.<br>‍<br>16.4.   Comet Rocks provides the additional services only subject to a corresponding Order Form mutually agreed by the Parties in writing. <br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">17. Warranty<br><br>‍</strong>17.1.   Comet Rocks shall be liable for any defects of the Comet Platform in accordance with the statutory provisions. Comet Rocks will remedy such defects at its own discretion within the scope of the maintenance services to be provided in accordance with § 14. <br>‍<br>17.2.   Comet Rocks shall not be liable for any defects caused by Merchant or any of Merchant’s Authorized Users or other persons or entities engaged by Merchant (e.g. defects caused by wrong configuration of the Comet Platform or defects caused by errors of the Merchant Systems). Comet Rocks will remedy such defects in accordance with § 16.<br>‍<br>17.3.   Any strict liability for initial defects according to Sec. 536a para. 1, 1st alt. of the German Civil Code (BGB) is hereby excluded.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">18. Liability<br><br>‍</strong>18.1. Comet Rocks shall be fully liable in cases of any loss or damages caused by willful intent (<em>Vorsatz</em>) or gross negligence (<em>grobe Fahrlässigkeit</em>), in cases of damages that result from injury to life, body or health, in case of liability provided by law, as under the Product Liability Act (<em>Produkthaftungsgesetz</em>) and in cases of liability due to a guarantee (<em>Garantie</em>).<br><br>18.2. In case of slight negligence (<em>einfacher Fahrlässigkeit</em>), Comet Rocks shall only be liable if any loss or damage is cause by an infringement of a fundamental contractual duty (<em>wesentliche Vertragspflicht</em>). In such case, Comet Rocks’ liability shall be limited to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage. A fundamental contractual duty in the aforementioned sense is a duty which is essential for duly execution of the Agreement and the achievement of the Agreement’s purpose and on whose compliance the other Party regularly relies on. The typically foreseeable damage is any damage which occurs as typical effect in a normal course of a damaging event.<br><br>18.3. With respect to Comet Rocks’ liability against Merchant under § 18.2, the Parties agree that such typically foreseeable damage does not exceed the remuneration paid by the Merchant to Comet Rocks for provision of the services under the Agreement in the twelve months preceding the damaging event.<br><br>18.4. Otherwise, Comet Rocks’ liability shall be excluded.18.5. In case of § 18.1 the statutory limitation period shall apply. Otherwise, damage claims shall become time-barred within twelve (12) months of becoming aware of them, but no later than ten (10) years after their occurrence.<br><br>18.6.

If a Party is affected by an event of Force Majeure, the affected Party must immediately inform the respective other Party, stating (i) the date on which the event of Force Majeure occurred, (ii) a reasonable estimate regarding the termination of the same and (iii) the nature of the Force Majeure. Each Party shall be relieved of its performance obligations for the duration of the disruption caused by the Force Majeure event and to the extent of its effect, even if it should be in default. Liability for damages caused by the event of Force Majeure to either Party is excluded.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">19. Indemnification<br><br>‍</strong>19.1. Comet Rocks warrants that the services provided as well as the rights granted by Comet Rocks to Merchant under this Agreement are free of third party rights, in particular free of intellectual property rights, such as patent rights, trademark rights and copyrights, or that Comet Rocks has been granted corresponding rights of use by the respective rights holder and that the use and/or application of the Comet Platform does not lead to any patent, license or other property right infringement. In this respect Comet Rocks shall indemnify the Merchant against any claims of third parties, including reasonable attorney fees, provided that:  <br><br>19.1.1. Merchant notifies Comet Rocks immediately of any claim at least in text form;<br><br>19.1.2. Merchant does not take any legally relevant actions towards the third party, in particular does not settle out of court without the written consent of the other party, does not make an acknowledgement or does not take any other actions which are equivalent to this;<br><br>19.1.3. Merchant supports Comet Rocks in the legal defense against the third party to the necessary extent, in particular by providing information; and <br><br>19.1.4. Merchant grants Comet Rocks the possibility to determine and implement the strategy of the legal defense, in particular by selecting lawyers and drafting pleadings. For this purpose, the Merchant shall provide the necessary declarations and grant powers of attorney.

In addition to the aforementioned provisions in this § 19, Comet Rocks shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that Merchant can use the services provided by Comet Rocks even in the event of conflicting third party rights. For this purpose, Comet Rocks may:<br><br>19.2.1. procure the necessary rights required for the use of the services as agreed under this Agreement; or <br><br>19.2.2. modify or replace the services in such a way that their use is not restricted and the third parties’ rights are no longer affected.<br><br>19.3. Should the provision of the necessary rights and/or the necessary changes unreasonably affect Comet Rocks is Comet Rocks entitled to terminate the Agreement vis-à-vis the Merchant. Further rights of the Parties shall remain unaffected.<br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">20. Remuneration, Payment Terms<br><br>‍</strong>20.1. Merchant shall make the following payments to Comet Rocks under this Agreement:<br><br>20.1.1.

Payment of a variable fee for each completed transaction executed via the Comet Platform equal to a specific percentage of such transaction, net of any taxes and shipping fees (“<strong class="body-bold">Transaction Fee</strong>”), as defined in Comet Rocks’ Price List.<br><br>20.1.3. Reimbursement in the amount of a variable fee for the processing of payments charged by the respective payment processor to Comet Rocks, if any (“<strong class="body-bold">Reimbursement Payment</strong>”).

Any reference to Comet Rocks’ Price List means the current version of the Price List applicable at the respective time and which may be updated from time to time. <br><br>20.3. Comet Rocks reserves the right to increase the Platform Fee and the Transaction Fee based on Comet Rocks’ applicable Price List upon written notice to Merchant, provided, that any such increase may only be made once per calendar year.

Any services provided by Comet Rocks to Merchant that go beyond the scope of services set forth in this Agreement shall be charged to Merchant based on time and material and in accordance with the applicable rates set forth in Comet Rocks’ Price List, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise in writing.<br><br>20.5. Any fees mentioned in this Agreement, including any Order Form or the Price List, are net amounts, meaning exclusive of any applicable tax, in particular value added tax (&quot;<strong class="body-bold">VAT</strong>&quot;) (<em>Umsatzsteuer</em>) at the respective statutory rate.<br><br>20.6. Comet Rocks will invoice all fees to Merchant on a monthly basis and all fees set forth in such invoice shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the invoice. <br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">21.

The Agreement has an initial term of 12 months and automatically renews at the frequency of three (3) months, unless agreed otherwise in a specific Order Form. Either Party may terminate the Agreement by giving written notice thereof at least 30 days prior to the end of the respective term. <br><br>21.2. Any rights of the Parties to terminate this Agreement for due cause remain unaffected. The Parties shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement for due cause, if there is a cause which makes the continuation of this Agreement unacceptable for one Party, even taking into account the justified interests of the other Party. <br><br>21.3. Each Party is in particular entitled to terminate this Agreement without notice for due cause if:<br><br>21.3.1. a supervisory authority objects to the execution of this Agreement and a time limit set by such authority to cure the relevant defect has expired unsuccessfully, or such authority prohibits at least one of the Parties from further executing this Agreement;<br><br>21.3.2. the other Party repeatedly and/or significantly violated the provisions of this Agreement.<br><br>21.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Comet Rocks is also entitled to terminate this Agreement without notice for good cause if any fees owed by Merchant are more than thirty (30) days overdue until such amounts are paid in full:<br><br>21.5. Any notice of termination must be in writing. The date of receipt of the letter of termination shall be decisive for compliance with the deadline.<br><br>21.6. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Merchant and its Authorized Users shall no longer be entitled to access and use the Comet Platform. The Merchant shall ensure that it backs up and/or migrates any Merchant Data stored in the Comet Platform in due time before the expiry of the term of the Agreement. Comet Rocks will assist with the export and migration of any Merchant Data if and to the extent agreed by the Parties in accordance with § 16. <br><br>21.7. When entering into this Agreement for the first time, Merchant is entitled to test the Comet Platform for a period of three (3) months days free of charge (“<strong class="body-bold">Trial Period</strong>”) and, after the Trial Period has expired, to terminate the Agreement without reason. If Merchant does not terminate the Agreement within the Trial Period, the Agreement will continue to apply and the initial term set forth in § 21.1 will begin at the end of the Trial Period. Merchant is only eligible for using the Trial Period once. <br><br><br><strong class="heading-5">22. Confidentiality<br><br>‍</strong>22.1. Any information, findings, results, data and documents disclosed between the Parties or obtained by one Party in connection with this Agreement or its execution (&quot;<strong class="body-bold">Confidential Information</strong>&quot;) shall be subject to confidentiality, regardless of how they are embodied, how they are communicated or obtained (e.g. by unencrypted e-mail) or whether they are expressly marked as requiring confidentiality (e.g. &quot;confidential&quot; or &quot;secret&quot;). <br><br>22.2. The Parties shall use any Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement and as required for its execution as well as only within the limits provided for in this Agreement.

The Parties shall undertake appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent Confidential Information from being subject to unauthorized use, access or disclosure. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law or by order of a court, supervisory authority or other judicial or administrative body.<br><br>22.4. The Parties are obliged to ensure that any Authorized Users as well as any other employees, persons and entities who have access to Confidential Information are subject to confidentiality in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, these confidentiality obligations shall also be imposed on the employees of the respective Party for the time after their employment is terminated. <br><br>22.5.

The confidential obligations set forth in this Agreement shall remain in force after termination of this Agreement for an additional period of three (3) years, irrespective of the type of termination. Upon termination of the Agreement, the receiving Party will upon request of the disclosing Party return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information, unless the receiving Party is subject to a statutory retention obligation.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="heading-5">23.

For this purpose, the Parties enter into the Data Processing Agreement by executing this Agreement.<br>23.4.

However, this does not relief Merchant of having in place sufficient backup measures; Merchant remains to be obliged to implement and maintain sufficient backup routines regarding its Merchant Data.
