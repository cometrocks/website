LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, so we can use this data to display targeted ads outside of our website without identifying the member. LinkedIn also uses data that does not identify you to improve the relevance of ads and reach members across devices. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes in their account settings.<br><br>The legal basis for this data processing is your consent pursuant to Art.6 para.1 lit. a GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by accessing the settings of our consent management tool and changing your selection there. Please note that the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent prior to your withdrawal remains unaffected.<br><br> In addition, you can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Website (including your IP address) to LinkedIn and the processing of this data by LinkedIn, by downloading and installing the browser add-on to disable LinkedIn Analytics available <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out" class="text-blue"> here</a>. <br><br>For more information on LinkedIn Analytics functionality and LinkedIn&#x27;s privacy policy, please see the following links:<br>‍<br>
